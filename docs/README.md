# Documentation Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
## Local Development

First, generate MDX files for API: 

```bash
npx docusaurus gen-api-docs all
```

Documentation about docusaurus Open API docs generation can be found [here](https://docusaurus-openapi.tryingpan.dev/).

Then, start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
